  - title: What the hell is a container
    description: "We'll show how you can create a container without using docker, to illustrate those 3 main features that helps maintaining isolation on different levels.
        During this confinement period, I realized that the preventative and healthy measurements taken by governments and Docker to emphasis isolation are somehow similar and symmetrical, so i'm making a fun comparison to remind the three main linux kernel features used by Docker under the hood to maintain isolation between containers.

  - title: Efficient Cloud workloads with GraalVM
    description: "The cloud is ubiquitous and can take many forms: from infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where you get low-level control, to function as a service (FaaS), where the platform is essentially abstracted away and managed for you. No matter the model used, startup time, low resource consumption, and overall performance are key goals for deploying a workload in the cloud. This session discusses how GraalVM, a high-performance, open source, polyglot virtual machine, helps meet those goals. It addresses how GraalVM can be used in IaaS/platform as a service (PaaS) setups and then looks at the other side of the cloud spectrum—FaaS—and explains how GraalVM can be leveraged for serverless functions. Attend this session to understand how to leverage GraalVM to improve your cloud (JVM) workload."
