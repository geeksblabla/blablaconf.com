I want this talk to answer the following questions :
Why some companies, like Shopify, are still using monolith architecture?
What is the modular monolith?
When to go from a monolith to microservices?
When starting a new project what to choose for my architecture?
What software architects said about monolith vs microservices?
A bit about the role of Rails in building a reputation for monolith apps."
